# MOVIE MAGIC APP üìù- ADA ITW

_Deploy link hosted on VERCEL_ >> https://movie-magic-app.vercel.app/

MOVIE MAGIC APP allows you to scroll through several filtered lists of movies from The Movie Database API (TMDB - https://www.themoviedb.org/), such as: Latest Releases, Populars and Top Rated.
This site also lets you search movies by an input form and offers any matching titles.

Whenever you like to get more info about a given movie a simple click on the lists or carrousel from the Home section or the movie cards from Latest Releases / Populars / Search sections redirects you to the movie Detail where you can find its Trailer if available.

As an extra feature you may create your own personal list from your favorite films through a simple click on the CAMERA ICON on either the cards or detail bookmarking them for later revision on the Favorites Section.
